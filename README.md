# personal rss

A self-hosted plataform to create a personal rss feed.

# Motivation

One of my frustrations is not having an easy way to share links with friends and colleagues. Using chat to this job (we currently using [mattermost](https://mattermost.com) at work) get channels all messed up. The solution that came to me is to create a tool to save the links and share them in a shareable way: RSS. The plus in this solution is that people can organize when and what read how they prefer (personally I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com)).
